I’m <b>Raúl Ferrer</b> — a Tech Lead, PhD in Chemistry, and lifelong self-learner.

After decades of building digital products, leading engineering teams, and adapting to every wave of change in tech, I’ve learned one thing: stagnation is a choice.

Now, I’m not starting over.
I’m building on everything I already know — by going deep into Artificial Intelligence.

## Why AI?
Because it’s not a trend. It’s the next great toolset for technical leadership.
Understanding AI is not optional for those who want to lead with vision, shape better products, and remain relevant in a changing world.

Over the next 12 months, I’m investing my energy in mastering applied AI.
I’ll be learning in public, building real-world projects, and writing about every insight, challenge, and breakthrough.

<b>This journey is not about hype. It’s about competence, clarity, and action.</b>

## What I bring
🧪 A scientific mindset (PhD in Chemistry)

💼 15+ years leading software teams and products

🚀 A proven ability to self-learn and execute

📣 A clear, authentic voice — and a willingness to share everything

## What I’m doing now
* Studying AI systems, ML fundamentals, and real-world applications (NLP, vision, agents)
* Building a portfolio of open-source and demo AI products
* Sharing my learnings weekly through blog posts, LinkedIn, and open notes
* Growing a network of professionals who believe in learning through doing

## Who this is for
If you're a technical leader curious about AI, a product builder looking for clarity, or someone who thinks “it’s too late to start” — this journey is for you.
I’m documenting every step to show that reinvention isn’t about age. It’s about mindset.

<b>Let’s build the future. One project, one post, one connection at a time.</b>
