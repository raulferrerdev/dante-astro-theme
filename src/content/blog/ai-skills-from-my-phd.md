## From multivariate calibration to machine learning pipelines — the scientific mindset travels farther than I thought (AI in Chemistry)

When I was deep into my PhD in Analytical Chemistry, surrounded by chromatograms, fluorescence signals, and endless spreadsheets of spectral data, I never imagined that years later I’d be applying similar thinking patterns to train AI models.

But here I am — learn artificial intelligence with the same scientific rigor I once applied to the detection of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in complex matrices.

This post isn’t just a story about changing fields. It’s about **how a scientific background — specifically in Analytical Chemistry — can be a surprisingly solid foundation for AI**. If you’re a scientist looking beyond the lab bench, or someone in tech curious about what science brings to the table, read on.

## The quiet intersection: chemometrics and early AI in Chemistry

During my doctoral research, I worked on detecting PAHs using **chemometrics** — a form of multivariate analysis that’s incredibly similar to what we now call classical machine learning. Techniques like **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**, **Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR)**, and even **Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)** were essential tools in my daily work.

Back then, we didn’t call it "AI" (AI in Chemistry) we called it **modeling**, **data fitting**, or just "making sense of the noise." But in hindsight, I was already doing machine learning — just within the context of spectroscopy and environmental analysis.

We were solving real problems: low detection limits, interferences, method validation, repeatability. It required **clean thinking, structured experimentation, and data-first reasoning**. These are not just chemistry skills. They’re transferable, powerful, and directly applicable to the world of AI.

## From curiosity to career shift

Like many scientists, I didn't leave the lab because I hated science. I left because I was **curious about the world beyond the PhD**.

What started as passive reading on data science blogs turned into nights spent watching online courses, downloading Kaggle datasets, and testing small Python scripts. I didn’t make the leap immediately. I needed time — not just to learn new tools, but to reframe how I saw myself.

And here’s what helped: **realizing that the mindset I developed in chemistry was still incredibly valuable**.

## What Analytical Chemistry teaches you about AI

I used to believe that switching into AI meant starting from zero.

I was wrong.

Here are the top lessons from my scientific background that now shape how I learn and apply AI:

---

### 1. The scientific method is the ultimate debugging tool

When you’ve spent years setting up experiments, testing one variable at a time, documenting every possible error source — you develop a kind of mental discipline that’s rare in fast-paced software culture.

That discipline helps in AI too:
- When your model overfits: you go back to basics.
- When your metrics don’t improve: you question assumptions.
- When your pipeline fails: you isolate and test each component.

You’re not just coding — you’re experimenting.

---

### 2. Thinking in dimensions

Spectral data is inherently multivariate. Each sample is a vector of absorbance values, intensities, or emission peaks.

So when I started working with feature matrices in machine learning, it felt... familiar. Instead of wavelengths, I now deal with pixels or token embeddings. But the **intuition for multidimensional data** is the same.

---

### 3. Data integrity is everything

In Analytical Chemistry, **garbage in = garbage out** is not just a phrase — it’s a daily battle. You don’t trust a result until the controls check out, the baseline is clean, and the method is validated.

In AI, we often forget this. But my chemistry mindset won’t let me.

Before training a model, I scrutinize the data. I look for drift. I question the labels. I inspect outliers. Because I know — painfully well — how small flaws in input data can destroy the entire analysis.

---

### 4. Communicating uncertainty

Another transferable skill? **Reporting results with uncertainty**.

Chemists don't just give numbers. We give ranges, confidence intervals, detection limits. We know how to interpret error and talk about limitations.

In AI, that becomes an asset — especially in sensitive fields like healthcare or education, where overconfidence can have real consequences.

---

## Small AI steps, real-world value

Today, I’m working on small applied projects in AI. Some involve **OCR (optical character recognition)**. Others involve **image detection pipelines**. They’re far from cutting-edge research — but they’re real.

And that’s what excites me: not chasing hype, but applying AI **responsibly and effectively** in domains I care about — like education and health.

These are fields where **interdisciplinary thinking is desperately needed**. Where data is messy, stakeholders are non-technical, and the margin for error is small. In other words — exactly the kind of environment analytical chemists thrive in.

---

## Interdisciplinarity is not a buzzword — it’s a career

There’s a strange belief in tech that you need to have a "pure" background to succeed. That you need to be a software engineer from day one, or a data scientist with only one focus.

But the real value often lies in the **intersection of disciplines**.

My chemistry PhD taught me how to structure problems. AI gives me the tools to scale those solutions. Together, they create a profile that’s hard to find — and even harder to replace.

So if you’re reading this and wondering whether your scientific training is still relevant in the AI world, let me be clear:

> **It absolutely is.**

Not only relevant — it’s *needed*.

## What’s next?

My journey into AI is far from over. I’m still learning every week. Still writing ugly Python scripts. Still breaking things and reading documentation at 1AM.

But I now see this path not as a detour — but as a **continuation** of the same mindset that got me through a PhD:

- Ask good questions.  
- Follow the data.  
- Think critically.  
- Communicate clearly.  
- Never stop learning.

## Final thoughts (and a quiet call to action)

If you're a scientist wondering where to go next — don’t discard what you already know.

If you're in AI and hiring for your team — don't overlook candidates with PhDs in fields like chemistry or biology.

And if you're like me — somewhere in between disciplines, learning as you go — know that you're not alone.

I’m happy to connect with others walking this path. Let’s learn together.
