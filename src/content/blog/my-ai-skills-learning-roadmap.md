## Beyond Code: My 18-Month AI Roadmap as a Tech Lead

---

For the past 10+ years, I'm' leading mobile engineering teams, shipped apps across platforms, and helped others grow into better developers.

But I’ve always believed that strong leadership means never becoming static.

That’s why, not long ago, I started building something for myself:  
A long-term, flexible learning path to deepen my understanding of **AI and Machine Learning**, not to “switch careers,” but to **enhance how I think, lead, and build as a technical leader**.

## Why AI/ML Matters for Tech Leads Today

We’re not in the AI hype era anymore—AI is infrastructure.  
Whether it’s **OCR in mobile apps**, **recommendation engines**, or **fraud detection**, it’s reshaping how we build products and lead teams.

If you're a tech lead or senior engineer, the real shift is this:

> You don’t need to become a data scientist.  
> But you *do* need to understand how data, models, and intelligent systems are shaping modern development.

AI is now part of the tech lead toolbox—like architecture, code review, or system design.

## My 18-Month AI Learning Roadmap (Flexible and Evolving)

This roadmap isn’t rigid. It evolves based on:
- What I’m curious about
- How the field progresses
- What’s most useful to my current and future work

## It’s Not a Rigid Plan—And That’s the Point

Learning isn’t linear.

Some weeks I go deeper into TensorFlow, other weeks I just read papers or run image detection tests with my own data.

This roadmap is **living**. And it should be. This roadmap isn't carved in stone — courses or tools may be replaced along the way as technologies evolve and my needs as a tech lead shift.

Because real growth happens when you build, reflect, share… and iterate.

## Final Thoughts for Other Tech Leads

- You don’t need to reinvent yourself.  
- You just need to stay relevant, curious, and adaptive.  
- A little structure beats pure curiosity.  
- A little curiosity beats pure planning.

This is the long game. And if you’re on a similar journey—whether it's AI, Web3, or quantum—I’d love to follow along.

Feel free to share your roadmap or thoughts.

Let’s lead with code *and* with insight.
